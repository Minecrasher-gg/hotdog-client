🌭 Hotdog Client

Hotdog Client is a playful, experimental Minecraft client designed for fun, learning, and exploring the inner workings of Minecraft. Think of it as your sandbox for testing ideas, experimenting with game logic, and seeing what’s possible—without taking things too seriously.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This is a personal, experimental project. Use responsibly and only on servers you have permission to test on. This is not meant for cheating on public servers.
